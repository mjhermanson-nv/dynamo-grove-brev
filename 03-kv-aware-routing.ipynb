    "# Lab 3: KV-Aware Routing with Data-Parallel Workers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll learn about **KV-aware routing**, an intelligent load balancing feature that routes requests to workers based on their cached data. Unlike simple round-robin routing, KV-aware routing tracks which workers have already processed similar prompts and directs new requests to workers with matching cached blocks. This dramatically reduces the time to first token (TTFT) for repeated or similar queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Architecture:**\n",
    "- **2 Independent Workers** (GPUs 0-1): Each handles full inference (prefill + decode)\n",
    "- **KV-Aware Router**: Tracks which worker has cached which prompt prefixes\n",
    "- **NATS Message Bus**: Coordinates cache state across workers\n",
    "- Each worker stores its own local KV cache and publishes cache events to NATS\n",
    "\n",
    "**How KV-Aware Routing Works:**\n",
    "1. Request with prompt \"Explain quantum computing\" arrives\n",
    "2. Router checks: No worker has this cached → sends to Worker 1\n",
    "3. Worker 1 processes request and caches the prefill computation\n",
    "4. Worker 1 publishes cache event to NATS: \"I have blocks for 'Explain quantum computing'\"\n",
    "5. Router updates its tracking: Worker 1 has those cached blocks\n",
    "6. Next request: \"Explain quantum computing in simple terms\" arrives\n",
    "7. Router sees: Worker 1 has cached blocks for \"Explain quantum computing\" → sends to Worker 1\n",
    "8. Worker 1 reuses cached prefill blocks → much faster TTFT!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "When users ask variations of similar questions, the router intelligently directs requests to workers that have already cached related computations. This avoids redundant prefill work and reduces time-to-first-token for cache-friendly workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use KV-aware routing:**\n",
    "- Chatbots with conversation history (similar context across turns)\n",
    "- Document Q&A systems (multiple questions about the same document)\n",
    "- Batch processing with shared system prompts\n",
    "- Any workload where prompt prefixes are repeated across requests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**: Complete Lab 1 (Dynamo Deployment) and Lab 2 (Monitoring)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration**: ~60 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Requires 2 GPUs. If Lab 1 is still running, you'll need to clean it up first.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Section 1: Understanding KV-Aware Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is KV-Aware Routing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional load balancers distribute requests randomly or in round-robin fashion across workers, treating all workers as identical. But large language models cache intermediate computations (the \"KV cache\") to avoid reprocessing tokens they've already seen. **KV-aware routing** leverages this by tracking which workers have which cached blocks and intelligently routing requests to workers that can reuse cached data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "1. User asks: \"Explain quantum computing\" → Router sends to Worker 1\n",
    "2. Worker 1 processes the prompt and caches it\n",
    "3. User follows up: \"Explain quantum computing in simple terms\" → Router notices the shared prefix and sends to Worker 1\n",
    "4. Worker 1 reuses the cached computation for \"Explain quantum computing\", only processes the new part\n",
    "5. Result: **Much faster** time-to-first-token (TTFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How KV-Aware Routing Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐\n",
    "│ Worker 1 │  │ Worker 2 │  (Data-parallel: identical workers)\n",
    "└────┬─────┘  └────┬─────┘\n",
    "     │             │\n",
    "     └─────────────┘\n",
    "            │ Publish cache events\n",
    "            ↓\n",
    "   ┌────────────────┐\n",
    "   │  NATS Server   │  (Message bus for cache coordination)\n",
    "   │  (Message Bus) │\n",
    "   └────────┬───────┘\n",
    "            │ Subscribe to events\n",
    "            ↓\n",
    "   ┌────────────────┐\n",
    "   │  KV Router     │  (Tracks which worker has which cached blocks)\n",
    "   │ (Global Index) │\n",
    "   └────────────────┘\n",
    "            ↓\n",
    "   Routes requests to workers with matching cached prefixes\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Flow:**\n",
    "1. **Request arrives**: \"Explain quantum computing\"\n",
    "2. **Router checks cache index**: No worker has this cached → picks Worker 1\n",
    "3. **Worker 1 processes**: Creates KV cache blocks 0-5\n",
    "4. **Worker 1 publishes to NATS**: \"I cached blocks 0-5 for prefix 'Explain quantum computing'\"\n",
    "5. **Router updates index**: Worker 1 has these blocks\n",
    "6. **Next request arrives**: \"Explain quantum computing in simple terms\"\n",
    "7. **Router checks cache index**: Worker 1 has matching prefix → routes to Worker 1\n",
    "8. **Worker 1 reuses cache**: Blocks 0-5 already computed, only processes new tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why NATS?** Kubernetes provides service discovery (which workers exist) but not cache coordination (what's cached where). NATS handles thousands of cache events per second with low latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When KV-Aware Routing Helps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:**\n",
    "- ✅ Chatbots and conversational AI (repeated system prompts, conversation history)\n",
    "- ✅ Document Q&A (same document, different questions)\n",
    "- ✅ Batch processing with shared prefixes\n",
    "- ✅ Code assistants (repeatedly analyzing same files)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Not ideal for:**\n",
    "- ⚠️ Completely unique prompts every time\n",
    "- ⚠️ Single worker deployments (no routing decisions to make)\n",
    "- ⚠️ Very short contexts (cache overhead exceeds benefit)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Multi-GPU/Multi-Node Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this lab (single node, 2 GPUs):**\n",
    "- Each GPU runs a separate worker\n",
    "- Router can direct requests to the worker with the best KV cache match\n",
    "- Workers store their own local KV cache (no transfer between workers in data-parallel mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **💡 Note: Production Multi-Node Deployments**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> In production environments with multiple nodes:\n",
    "> - Scale workers across nodes for higher throughput\n",
    "> - Deploy multiple frontend replicas for high availability\n",
    "> - Kubernetes Services automatically load balance across frontend replicas\n",
    "> - KV-aware routing works across nodes via NATS coordination\n",

    "- NATS coordinates cache state across workers (events published/subscribed)\n",
    "- Router tracks which workers have cached which prefixes\n",
    "- Requests with similar prefixes get routed to the same worker for cache reuse\n",
    "- Scales horizontally—add more workers for more traffic\n",
    "- Works on single nodes with multiple GPUs or across multi-node clusters\n",

    "**Key architectural choice:**\n",
    "- Use **disaggregated serving** (Lab 1) for predictable latency on individual requests\n",
    "- Use **distributed serving** (Lab 3) when you have high traffic with cache-friendly patterns\n",
