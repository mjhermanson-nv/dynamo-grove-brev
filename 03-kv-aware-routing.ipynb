    "# Lab 3: Distributed Dynamo with Multi-GPU/Multi-Node Serving\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll learn about **KV-aware routing**, an intelligent load balancing feature that routes requests to workers based on their cached data. Unlike simple round-robin routing, KV-aware routing tracks which workers have already processed similar prompts and directs new requests to workers with matching cached blocks. This dramatically reduces the time to first token (TTFT) for repeated or similar queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Architecture:**\n",
    "- **2 Independent Workers** (GPUs 0-1): Each handles full inference (prefill + decode)\n",
    "- **KV-Aware Router**: Tracks which worker has cached which prompt prefixes\n",
    "- **NATS Message Bus**: Coordinates cache state across workers\n",
    "- Each worker stores its own local KV cache and publishes cache events to NATS\n",
    "\n",
    "**How KV-Aware Routing Works:**\n",
    "1. Request with prompt \"Explain quantum computing\" arrives\n",
    "2. Router checks: No worker has this cached → sends to Worker 1\n",
    "3. Worker 1 processes request and caches the prefill computation\n",
    "4. Worker 1 publishes cache event to NATS: \"I have blocks for 'Explain quantum computing'\"\n",
    "5. Router updates its tracking: Worker 1 has those cached blocks\n",
    "6. Next request: \"Explain quantum computing in simple terms\" arrives\n",
    "7. Router sees: Worker 1 has cached blocks for \"Explain quantum computing\" → sends to Worker 1\n",
    "8. Worker 1 reuses cached prefill blocks → much faster TTFT!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "When users ask variations of similar questions, the router intelligently directs requests to workers that have already cached related computations. This avoids redundant prefill work and can reduce TTFT by 50% or more for cache-friendly workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How this differs from Lab 1:**\n",
    "- **Lab 1**: Disaggregated serving (specialized prefill → decode workers)\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Data-parallel serving (2 generalist workers, each does everything)\n",
    "- **Lab 1**: Workers cooperate on each request (tightly coupled pipeline)\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Workers operate independently, router makes intelligent placement decisions\n",
    "- **Lab 1**: NIXL for prefill→decode KV cache transfer\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: Local KV cache per worker, NATS for cache event coordination\n",
    "- **Lab 1**: No NATS needed (direct worker communication via NIXL)\n",
    "- **Lab 3**: NATS required for router to track cache state across workers\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use KV-aware routing:**\n",
    "- Chatbots with conversation history (similar context across turns)\n",
    "- Document Q&A systems (multiple questions about the same document)\n",
    "- Batch processing with shared system prompts\n",
    "- Any workload where prompt prefixes are repeated across requests\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**: Complete Lab 1 (Dynamo Deployment) and Lab 2 (Monitoring)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration**: ~60 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Requires 2 GPUs. If Lab 1 is still running, you'll need to clean it up first.\n",

    "## Section 1: Understanding KV-Aware Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is KV-Aware Routing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional load balancers distribute requests randomly or in round-robin fashion across workers, treating all workers as identical. But large language models cache intermediate computations (the \"KV cache\") to avoid reprocessing tokens they've already seen. **KV-aware routing** leverages this by tracking which workers have which cached blocks and intelligently routing requests to workers that can reuse cached data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "1. User asks: \"Explain quantum computing\" → Router sends to Worker 1\n",
    "2. Worker 1 processes the prompt and caches it\n",
    "3. User follows up: \"Explain quantum computing in simple terms\" → Router notices the shared prefix and sends to Worker 1\n",
    "4. Worker 1 reuses the cached computation for \"Explain quantum computing\", only processes the new part\n",
    "5. Result: **Much faster** time-to-first-token (TTFT)\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "You've deployed a distributed Dynamo architecture where multiple workers collaborate to serve requests. Unlike Lab 1's disaggregated approach (specialized prefill/decode workers), this distributed model uses identical workers that share cached computations over the network via NIXL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes this powerful:**\n",
    "- Workers discover each other automatically through Kubernetes\n",
    "- KV cache sharing speeds up similar or follow-up requests\n",
    "- Scales horizontally—add more workers for more traffic\n",
    "- Works on single nodes with multiple GPUs or across multi-node clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key architectural choice:**\n",
    "- Use **disaggregated serving** (Lab 1) for predictable latency on individual requests\n",
    "- Use **distributed serving** (Lab 3) when you have high traffic with cache-friendly patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps:** Experiment with different worker counts, monitor cache hit rates in Grafana, or explore the optional NATS/etcd setup in Appendix B for extreme-scale deployments.\n",
